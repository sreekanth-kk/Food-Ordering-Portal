Created an API which returns food items on the home
page and other food items in the sub page.

Created APIs to

a. Add items to a cart

b. Remove items from the cart

c. Clear the cart data

For using food related images in my application, downloaded images from sites like
Pixabay and then uploaded the images to Cloudinary CDN to get image URLs to be used in
API response.
